# 121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[链接](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**思路分析**

需要维护两个数据：前i个数的最小值min，和当前最大差值maxDiff

遍历比较时

- 查看第i-1的数是否小于min，如果是则更新min
- 计算第i个数的最大差值，查看是否最大差值需要更新

结果输出时，如果maxDiff小于0，则输出0，否则直接输出结果

**我的实现**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        //1.判断输入是否合法
        if( prices.size() < 2 )
            return 0;
        //2.记录前i个数字中的最小值
        int min = prices[0];
        //3.记录最大差值
        int maxDiff = prices[1] - min;
        //4.遍历数组
        for( int i = 2; i <= prices.size() - 1; i++ )
        {
            //6.如果第i-1个数比当前记录的最小值要小，更新最小值
            if( min > prices[i-1] )
                min = prices[i-1];
            //7.如果当前的差值比记录的最大差值要大，更新最大差值
            int currentDiff = prices[i] - min;
            if( currentDiff > maxDiff )
                maxDiff = currentDiff;
        }
        
        if( maxDiff <= 0 )
            return 0;
        else
            return maxDiff;
    }
};
```
